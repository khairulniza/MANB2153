This might be a result from the user that is reluctant to share thier complete information or not using thier real information. Reserchers also mentioned that data mining tools can uncover more useful rules that are easy to understand. But for online users, data should be considered from different perspectives."

    ">Research is aims to solve the cancer classification problem using single decision tree classifiers (ie: algorithms C4.5 and CART) and decision tree forests (e.g. random forests) and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methodologies in comparison to other popular classification methods.\n",
    "\n",
    ">As mentioned in the paper, the choice of the classification method is not definite and different classification algorithms fit different problems – there is no dominant method. Furthermore, according to the researchers, decision trees are proven to be as effective as other classifiers and exceed the efficiency of other classifiers for particular problems. \n",

    "\n",
    "> Acording to the paper, previous researchers also give preference to decision tree classifiers because of their ability of relevant gene selection and scalability, as well as model accuracy and easy interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In the conclusion chapter, researchers conclude that with right data pre-processing, decision trees and their ensembles can be very efficient and outperform other methods. Better results can be achieved using aggregation of decision tree classifiers like bagging, boosting and Random forests.  "

By far, decison tree however not been used widely by the remote sensing community for land use classification despite their non-parametric nature and their attractive properties of simplicity, flexibility, and computational efficiency in handling the non-normal, non-homogeneous and noisy data, as well as non-linear relations between features and classes, missing values, and both numeric and categorical inputs. \n",

    ">a decision tree classification algorithm for remotely sensed satellite data using separability matrix of spectral distributions of probable classes has been developed. The overall accuracy for the sample test image was found to be 98% using the Decision Tree method and 95% using the Maximum Likelihood method with kappa values 97% and 94 % respectively. \n"
